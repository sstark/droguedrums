droguedrums is a text file based drum sequencer for the command line.

It reads a definition of drum sets, parts and sequences from a text file and
plays it back as midi. No sounds are provided. Development is done with the
following workflow in mind:

  - define rhythmical patterns using a simple text file
  - feed midi data to a hardware drum synthesizer
  - process and record the audio from hardware

There is a single input file containing definitions for drum kits, parts and
sequences. The file is specified at the command line.
