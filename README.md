Development version
===================

You may run `go get github.com/sstark/droguedrums` within a working go
installation to get the development version of droguedrums anytime. It should
pick the right midi library for your platform. However, this is not always
guaranteed to be stable (but the master branch should always pass all tests).

For releases please see the homepage.
